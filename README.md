# Unisolder-Personal-Take
Personal take / updated design for unisolder

I take no credit for the design or software in the project i am only building on the current Unisolder design. 

I was in the market for an upgraded station at home and stumbled across this project. I would like to do some design changes to make it easier to order the PCB mostly pick and placed. I am not looking to take the design as my own or profit off of it.

Starting with replica schematics, then producing a new BOM with packages available for pick and place.
